# Yelp-Data-Hackathon-Project

## Project Overview
This project was developed for the 24-hour data hackathon using the Yelp public dataset. Our goal was to analyze Yelp data to uncover insights that could enhance user experience on the platform. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aimed to provide a more nuanced understanding of what factors contribute to a business's success on Yelp, beyond just star ratings.

## Installation and Setup
Please ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can then install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may need to install additional libraries for specific analyses or visualizations. Refer to the [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/api/doc) and [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) documentation for more details on setting up natural language processing tools.

## Data Analysis
The analysis focuses on exploring the Yelp dataset to find correlations between business success and various factors such as location, category, and user reviews. We performed exploratory data analysis, sentiment analysis, and developed a weighted ranking algorithm to offer insights beyond traditional star ratings.

## Presentation
Our findings are presented in a concise 2-3 page PDF, emphasizing visualizations to convey our insights effectively. Key talking points include:

- Introduction to the team and the problem we're solving.
- The methodology behind our analysis, highlighting the use of sentiment analysis and linear regression.
- Insights gained from the analysis, including the importance of considering review sentiment alongside star ratings and review counts.

## Future Work
The project outlines potential future enhancements such as integrating AI for more advanced predictive analytics and further refining our algorithms to better serve Yelp's users and businesses.
